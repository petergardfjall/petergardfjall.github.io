# About

Not much here to see at the moment.

The repo doesn't (yet) have a higher purpose but essentially serves as a CDN for
utility files:

- CSS and javascript files referenced in my [emacs
  init.el](https://github.com/petergardfjall/dotfiles/blob/master/emacs-init.el)
  to make `markdown-preview-mode` produce Github-like preview rendering
  of markdown documents.
